# Project : Sales Prediction Using Python, CodSoft Internship.
(https://github.com/KhushiML/Data_ScienceProjects/blob/main/Sales%20Prediction%20Using%20Python%20Final.ipynb)
## Description :
- Sales prediction involves forecasting the amount of a product that customers will purchase, taking into account various factors such as advertising expenditure, target 
  audience segmentation, and advertising platform selection.
- Used **Neural Network** (Accuracy = 99.67%, Mean Absolute Error = 0.0062) for building Sales Prediction Model.

# Project: Classification With Neural Network
(https://github.com/KhushiML/Data_ScienceProjects/blob/main/Classification%20with%20Neural%20Network.ipynb)
## Description :
- Used famous MNIST fashion dataset, which contains 70,000 clothing fashion images. Here our task is to train an image classification model with neural 
  networks.
- Used **neural networks** to train an image classification model.
## Dataset
Here, I will be using the famous MNIST fashion dataset, which contains 70,000 clothing fashion images.

# Project : Language Detection with Machine Learning
(https://github.com/KhushiML/Data_ScienceProjects/blob/main/Language%20Detection%20Model.ipynb) or
(https://github.com/KhushiML/Data_ScienceProjects/blob/main/Language%20Identification%20Model%20Using%20Bernoulli%20Naive%20Bayes.ipynb)
## Description :
- Language detection is a natural language processing task where we need to identify the language of a text or document.
- Used **Multinomial Naïve Bayes** (Accuracy = 95.31%) algorithm.
## Dataset
The dataset that I am using is collected from Kaggle, which contains data about 22 popular languages and contains 1000 sentences in each of the languages.

# Project : Real-Time Sentiment Analysis.
(https://github.com/KhushiML/Data_ScienceProjects/blob/main/Real-Time%20Sentiment%20Analysis.ipynb)
## Description :
- Sentiment Analysis is an application of natural language processing that is used to understand people’s opinions by asking users about their service.
- Used **SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()** class provided by the NLTK library in Python.
## Dataset:
To analyze feelings in real-time, we need to request input from the user and then analyze user feelings given by him/her as input. For this real-time sentiment analysis task using Python, I used the **NLTK toolkit** in Python which is a very useful tool for all the tasks of natural language processing.

# Project : Text Summarization using NLP
[https://github.com/KhushiML/Data_ScienceProjects/blob/main/Text%20Summarization%20Using%20NLP.ipynb]
## Description:
- Text summarization is the process of distilling the most important information from a source text.
- Used **spaCy** library here for natural language processing.

# Project : Next Word Prediction Model
(https://github.com/KhushiML/Data_ScienceProjects/blob/main/Next%20Word%20Prediction%20Model%20.ipynb)
## Description:
-  built a **sequential neural network** (Accuracy = 95.88%) with specific layers such as **Embedding, LSTM and Dense**.

# Project: OCR of Handwritten digits
(https://github.com/KhushiML/Data_ScienceProjects/blob/main/OCR%20of%20Handwritten%20digits.ipynb)
## Description:
- Optical Character Recognition is a computer vision technique used to identify the different types of handwritten digits.
- Used **OpenCV and KNN algorithm** (Accuracy = 91.64%).

# Project : IPL Score Prediction Using Deep Learning
(https://github.com/KhushiML/Data_ScienceProjects/blob/main/IPL%20Score%20Prediction%20Using%20Machine%20Learning.ipynb)
## Description:
- Built a **sequential neural network** (Accuracy = 58.76%).

 # Project: Voice Assistant using python
 (https://github.com/KhushiML/Data_ScienceProjects/blob/main/Voice%20Assistant%20using%20Python.py)
 ## Description:
 - Used the **speech_recognition and pyttsx3** libraries for speech recognition and text-to-speech synthesis.
